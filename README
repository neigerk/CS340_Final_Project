To compile the program:
    1. In the terminal navigate to the folder with the .cpp file (should be the
    same as this README file, unless they have been moved since unzipping).

    2. Run the following command in the terminal:

        g++ -std=c++11 WrestlerRivalries.cpp -o WrestlerRivalries

Once compiled, enter the name of the program into the terminal, followed by the name of the input file.

        WrestlerRivalries "input file"

        for example:

        WrestlerRivalries input.txt
